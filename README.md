# TLLPS

~~used originally for the TLLPS, TLLPS Template is a template for making your own The Lost Landscapes server.~~

being used for the TLLPS, you can just fork it, but you should make changes and credit TheLocalMoon for the original.
distributing the TLLPS is allowed, only if you credit either the [discord server](https://discord.gg/tmvFMkqSgf), either credit "gmod13" in Discord.
